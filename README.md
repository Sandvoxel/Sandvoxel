**ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C# and Unity**
**ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a private game project with a team of individuals**

I am a passionate programmer with a drive to learn new skills. I have the most experience with java, but also have other languages such as C#, C, and JS. I have been programing since I was in middle school. Programing was something that I had picked up because I wanted to mod the games I play.
